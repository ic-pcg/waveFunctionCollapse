WaveFunctionCollapse implementation in C 
========================================

*This project was based on the [Maxim Gumin's wave function algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse).*

The program determines a bitmap based on the input consisting of smaller tiles (.png) as well as a set of constraints (.xml). The purpose is to create an image that is [*locally similar*](#Local-Similarity) to the input images.

## Introduction

The name of the algorithm stems from the Quantum Mechanics, where it refers to a [behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) of minuscule particles which gradually determines their position in space. Similar in a broad sense, WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) determines the orientation and coordinates of input tiles based on initial constraints. Let us consider a simplified example:

1. The bitmap consists of two spaces for tiles, which can be occupied by any of the four tiles with equal probabilities. The *entropy* of each space is 4 now. In our model, the algorithm will always choose the minimum *not-equal-to-one* entropy space and then choose randomly.

2. Let us say that the right space was chosen with a head occupying it. Now only straight and tail tiles satisfy the neighbourhood rules. The choice of the head tile *propagates* itself throughout the grid.

3. The tail is chosen at random. Valid image is determined, collapse terminates.

This execution principle is extended for custom tilesets and sizes of grids. Have a look at the image generated by the tiles inspired by [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), our home institution:

As you can probably spot, tiles can be rotated and flipped, the grid does not have to be a square, any rectangular shape can be specified.  

## Local similarity

This means in principle that:

> Tiles from the tileset built up the image (ideally all tile types are present in the image at least once, subject to constraints).

## Algorithm

### Input

The input consists of several files separated into two groups: **constraints and images**. 

#### Constraints 
Constrains is a single .xml file formatted as the following example:

```xml
<!-- dir = path_to_directory_with_png_files 
     size_x = width
     size_y = height
     -->

<tiles dir="./graphics/huxley_tiles/" size_x="10" size_y="10">
  
  <!-- each tile box follows the same pattern -->
  
  <!-- neccessary arguments
        file = name of the file 
        top/right/bottom/left = string that will be checked for equality, tiles with equal 
          values can be placed next to each other -->
  
  <!-- optional arguments -->
  
  <!-- flip: 
    1 - add a vertically flipped tile to the tileset
    2 - add a horizontally flipped tile
    3 - add both of the flips -->
  
  <!-- rotate:
    1 - 90 degrees
    2 - 180 degrees
    3 - 270 degrees -->
  
  <tile file="sky.png" top="sky" right="sky" bottom="sky" left="sky"/>

  <tile file="qtr_base.png" top="qtr" right="qtr_base" bottom="pavement" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_balcony.png" top="qtr" right="qtr_balcony" bottom="qtr" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_top_balcony.png" top="qtr_1" right="qtr_top_balcony" bottom="qtr" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_dome.png" top="qtr_2" right="qtr_dome" bottom="qtr_1" left="sky" flip="2"/>
  <tile file="qtr_spire.png" top = "sky" right="qtr_spire" bottom ="qtr_2" left="sky" flip="2" rotate = "1"/>

  <!-- optional constraints that set grid space to a particular tile type
    file = name of the file
    x/y - coordinates of the space (origin is upper left!)
    -->
  
  <constraint file="telephone.png" x="3" y ="9"/>
  
</tiles>
```

#### Images

This is a subdirectory with png files of the same width and height (and all square). See the graphics folder in the source.

### Execution

1. Read the input with optional rotations, flips and constraints.
2. Initialise a 2D array of 64 bitstrings (each bit corresponding to a tile type). True represents that a tile can occupy given space, false - the opposite. We will want all of those to have exactly one-bit set. Without specified constraints, all bitstrings will be set to 11111...
3. Loop:

  3a. Observation: Find elements of minimum entropy greater not equal to 1 (these spaces are already collapsed). If this is positive, go to the next step, otherwise, abort (a valid solution was not found).
  
  3b. Choose the element at random and collapse it (make its entropy 1).
  
4. If successfully terminated, we have a valid image generated. 

### Output

We have implemented a live updated working of the algorithm. It shows the average of pixel colours of each tile possible in an element. Here is an example:

## Possible extensions

The current state of the project represents 2 weeks of teamwork. We are aware that there are multiple aspects which could be improved, most notably:

* Setting the relative frequency of the tiles
* Extending the program to more dimensions (3D)
* Providing an interactive interface for users
* Adding more tilesets

If you feel like you would like to contribute, please do not hesitate to [message us](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasz-jakubowski-2b0a28161/).
We can gladly provide you with expertise and cooperation!

## Getting started

Unfortunately, there is currently no support for Windows, if you would like to contribute in this area please message us!

First you will need to install needed libraries in your terminal:

Ubuntu/Linux:
```shell
sudo apt-get install libxml2
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```
macOS:

```shell
brew install libxml2
brew install imagemagick && brew link imagemagick --force
```

Now, the CFLAGS in Makefiles are configured for Ubuntu, please change them on macOS:

--------------
macOS only:

1) In ./waveFunctionCollapse/Makefile:
```shell
CFLAGS= -Wall -O0 -std=c99 -pedantic `pkg-config --cflags --libs MagickWand` -lglut -framework OpenGL -pthread -I/usr/include/libxml2 -lxml2 -g
```
2) in ./waveFunctionCollapse/graphics/Makefile:
```shell
CFLAGS =  -Wall -O3 -std=c99 -Werror -pedantic -I/usr/local/Cellar/imagemagick/7.0.10-25/include/ImageMagick-7 -pthread -Wno-deprecated-declarations -DMAGICKCORE_HDRI_ENABLE=0 -DMAGICKCORE_QUANTUM_DEPTH=16
```

3) Change first threee includes in ./waveFunctionCollapse/graphics/graphicsRunner.h to 

```shell
#include <OpenGL/gl.h>
#include <OpenGL/glu.h>
#include <GLUT/glut.h>
```

4) In ./waveFunctionCollapse/run_wfc.c uncomment line 96

-------------

To build the project using Make run:
```shell
make
```

Provided make ran successfully, `run_wfc` has been created in the main folder. You can now run the program:
```shell
./run_wfc path/to/tileset.xml
```
We've set up a few sample tilesets for you to try out:
```shell
./run_wfc sample_inputs/python.xml
./run_wfc sample_inputs/rpg_map.xml
./run_wfc sample_inputs/huxley.xml
```
